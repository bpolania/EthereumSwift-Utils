# EthereumSwift-Utils

A collection of utility functions for ethereum for Swift similar to those created by the [Ethereum JavaScript Community](https://github.com/ethereumjs) but for iOS.

It's at a very early stage, but will be updated constantly as it's part of an active project.

SMP Libraries for BInt and BDouble can be also found in [mkrd](https://github.com/mkrd/Swift-Big-Integer) github
